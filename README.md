# Blockchain Simulation
Idea behind this project is to bring the blockchain technology close to people and understanding how crypto currency & blockchain born together.

Everything is in-memory operation, you might encounter heap-memory related errors at runtime (when you try with huge number of records)

Planning to integrate with camunda BPMN engine to get in-memory transactions, so you won't encounter any jvm heap errors at runtime.
